        <p>Although retraining programs and resources are still being put into place by the city, it turns out COVID may have helped some New York City businesses clean up their acts. <p>

       <p>My new analysis of the inspections done by the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found that fewer businesses are failing inspections or getting violations now than before. 22.54% of businesses inspected had a failed inspection or violation before COVID in comparison to 17.97% of businesses from the years after NYC lifted restrictions. 

        <p>Other findings from the analysis give insights into which businesses have done well, and which have closed, since COVID restrictions were lifted. <p>

        <p>The NYC marketplace has changed drastically from the types of businesses that are thriving versus the ones that are dying. The biggest change that transformed how businesses are run and conducted safely and legally is the COVID-19 pandemic. <p>
        <p>Licensing over 45,000 businesses across 40 industries, the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dca/index.page" target="_blank">NYC DCWP</a> has been licensing and surveilling companies since 1969. The DCWP’s mission is to protect the marketplace from harmful business practices and enforce a safe business environment for workers and customers, according to its website. <p>
        <p>The DCWP records were accessed from the NYC Open Data portal and covers the five NYC boroughs. Although the data starts in 2016, we are going to be looking at the data gathered in three segments, pre-COVID from July 2017 to February 2020, during the pandemic from March 2020 to June 2021, and post-pandemic data from July 2021 to the most available data of July 2023. <p>
        <p>The data does not include any breaks that the DCWP may have endured in inspections due to COVID-19 and who is inspecting the businesses and specifically determining each inspection result. Since New York state officially declared COVID-19 a state emergency in March 2020, the data is considered to be during the pandemic until New York lifted restrictions in June 2021. <p>
        <p>Businesses took inspections more seriously as a decrease in failed inspections resulted after the pandemic. Out of the 47,525 businesses that were inspected from the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 to June 2021, 0.56% of companies failed their inspection. Comparatively in the coming time after the pandemic from July 2021 to the most recent records of July 2023, 0.34% of companies failed inspection. <p>
        <p> Of the five NYC boroughs, Brooklyn surprisingly has the most failed inspections before, during and after the pandemic. <p>

        <p>But surprisingly COVID did not result in an increase of inspections finding businesses going “out of business.” <p>
        <p>During the pre-pandemic time period of July 2017 to February 2020, 12.2% of businesses were found out of business, while during the pandemic lockdown of March 2020 to June 2021, 8.8% went out of business. <p>

  <p>In order to bring more positive results from DCWP inspections, the department has focused on expanding their program with VIP, the Visiting Inspector Program for brick-and-mortar retail businesses. <p>
<p>The program launched in 2017, specifically for new businesses on the scene, but now the expansion that was announced this past March allows any business to have the opportunity to schedule a “violation-free” and informational visit from an inspector to help pass future inspections, according to their press release. <p>
<p>“The Visiting Inspector Program is an important tool for businesses to get up to speed with new laws and correct any potential violations before they are penalized. Nearly 11,000 brick-and-mortar businesses have already benefited from this resource, and the program’s expansion will only facilitate greater support towards compliance that prevents unnecessary fines,” New York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams commented. <p>
<p>Although there are some disparaging differences between the COVID-19 and post COVID-19 marketplace, the DCWP continues to do right by its consumers and workers that it serves. With an extensive background as a public servant to the state of New York prior to her involvement with the DCWP, Vilda Vera Mayuga, has served as the DCWP Commissioner since February 2022 and stresses their ongoing mission to the businesses of NYC. <p>
<p>“We strive to build a culture of compliance with our City’s laws to help local businesses and their workers thrive,” Mayuga said in a recent press release. "We are proud to expand our Visiting Inspector Program to help support even more local businesses with our education-first approach." <p>
